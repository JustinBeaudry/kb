# Downloads the prebuilt kb binary for your OS/arch from the latest GitHub
# release, verifies its SHA-256 against the release checksums file, and
# installs it onto your PATH.
#
# Environment overrides:
#   KB_VERSION      install a specific tag (e.g. 0.7.0) instead of latest
#   KB_INSTALL_DIR  install location (default: /usr/local/bin, falling back
#                   to $HOME/.local/bin when that is not writable). When set
#                   explicitly, the install fails rather than falling back,
#                   so scripted installs get the binary in the exact location
#                   or a clear error.
#
# POSIX sh, no bash-isms. Requires: curl or wget, tar, and sha256sum or shasum.
# Verification is mandatory: the installer refuses to install if the release
# has no checksums.txt or no SHA-256 tool is available.
